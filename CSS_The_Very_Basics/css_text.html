  <h1>All About Kartien</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Appearance</h2>
  <h3>Human Form</h3>
  <p>Kartein has straight, platinum white hair that flows down to his <a href="#nowhere">shoulders</a>, pale skin, and
    piercing blue eyes with
    blonde eyelashes. When using his ability, his eyes turn green lime. He is always seen wearing a white and cream
    colored suit with golden accessories consisting of a shirt, gilet, pants and a navy coat with golden rose shaped
    buttons. He's considered the most handsome top ranker.</p>

  <h3>Cat Form</h3>
  <p>In his cat form, Kartein takes the appearence of an emaciated white cat with his left ear clipped, signifying that
    he is neutered. Despite his unhealthy looking cat form, it doesn't seem to hinder his abilities as an awakened one.

  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>Kartein is an extremely prideful, talented and determined individual. He is extremely confident in his healing
    abilities and takes pride in them. Similarly to Kayden, Kartein sometimes references to himself in third person as a
    way to boast about his greatness.

    If he's set on something, he'll hardly change his mind. He will not treat a person if he does not want to; no matter
    how generous the offer is[1] or if the person in front of him is on the brink of death[2]. On the same note, when
    something interests him, such as gaining a new ability, he can get very insistent and persistent until he gets what
    he wants, by any means necessary.

    Regardless of his cynical attitude especially towards his enemies, he is more talkative around people he likes, as
    seen when he is with Jiwoo and Kayden.</p>

  <h2>Abilities and Fighting Prowess</h2>
  <p>Healing Abilities: Kartein is widely renowned as one of the best healers in the world. He is the only one to be
    able to restore a broken awakened one's core, which is considered to be an impossible feat, His healing abilities
    are not only limited to humans[1], considering that he was able to heal Duri's eye. He's able to use his healing
    abilities even in cat form[2]. However, his healing abilities leave him temporarily vulnerable. Since Kartein has
    many enemies, he refuses most requests to heal people for fear of being attacked.
