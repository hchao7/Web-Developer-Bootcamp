    <h3>About Sanji:</h3>
    <p>Sanji is a tall, slender man who commonly wears a black suit and smokes a cigarette. Before the timeskip, Sanji
      is seen with his blonde hair covering his left eye. However, after the timeskip, his hair covers his right eye.
      Before leaving his family, Sanji styled his hair in the opposite direction and wore a yellow shirt with a black
      number three on it. He also wore white pants, brown boots, and a yellow bandana. After leaving his family and
      still a child, he started wearing a white cook's uniform. Sanji grows a goatee during the timeskip, and concept
      art shows this was his original design.</p>
