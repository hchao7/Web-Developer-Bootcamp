    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Kayden (카이든 Kai-deun) or more commonly known as Kayden Break (카이든 브레이크 Kai-deun Beu-lei-keu [Kaiden Bureiku]) is
      the deuteragonist in the manhwa, Eleceed. He is notorious as one of the strongest unaffiliated awakeners who
      challenges the strong. Due to being heavily injured and needing to hide as he healed, he was forced to transform
      into a cat and can only maintain his human form by spending his energy.</p>

    <h2>Powers</h2>
    <p>As one of the most powerful awakeners in the world, Kayden has a long experience fighting other awakeners. Unlike
      most awakeners, Kayden never received any form of training and is entirely self-taught. He was able to create a
      high-level force control for himself and so far, he has taught this method to Jiwoo only.</p>
